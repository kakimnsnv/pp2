from datetime import date, timedelta
import datetime

# Exercise 1 - Write a Python program to subtract five days from current date.
# d1 = date.today() - timedelta(5)
# print(d1)

# Exercise 2 - Write a Python program to print yesterday, today, tomorrow.
# today = date.today()
# yesterday = today - datetime.timedelta(1)
# tomorrow = today + datetime.timedelta(1)
# print(yesterday, today, tomorrow, sep='\n')

# Exercise 3 - Write a Python program to drop microseconds from datetime.
# d = datetime.datetime.today().replace(microsecond=0)
# print(d)

# Exercise 4 - Write a Python program to calculate two date difference in seconds.
# a = datetime.datetime(2013,12,30,23,59,59)
# b = datetime.datetime(2013,12,31,23,59,59)

# print(int((b-a).total_seconds()))
